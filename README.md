# estimates

This is a price calculator for our services.

# contributing

The calculator is built using Svelte and published here using GitHub Pages (the contents of the /docs folder in the `master` branch).

## developing

Clone the repo, make sure you run node 12-something and you are good to go.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

NOTE: Before you push changes, run `npm run build` first and commit the changes inside docs/build.
